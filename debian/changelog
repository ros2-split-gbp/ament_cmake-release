  * Use file(GENERATE OUTPUT) to create dsv files (#416 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/416>)
    Using file(WRITE) and file(APPEND) causes the modification stamp of the
    file to be changed each time CMake configures, resluting in an
    'Installing' message rather than an 'Up-to-date' message even though the
    file content is identical.
    Using file(GENERATE OUTPUT) updates the timestamp of the file only if
    the content changes.
  * Warn when trying to symlink install an INTERFACE_LIBRARY (#417 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/417>)
  * Workaround to exclude Clion's cmake folders from colcon test (#410 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/410>)
    - Add AMENT_IGNORE to CMAKE_BINARY_DIR to avoid picking up cmake
    specific folders created by CLion in colcon build and colcon test
    commands

  * Resolve various ament_lint linter violations (#360 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/360>)
    We can't add ament_lint linters in ament_cmake in the traditional way
    without creating a circular dependency between the repositories. Even
    though we can't automatically enforce linting, it's still a good idea to
    try to keep conformance where possible.

  * Make it possible to ignore a package deprecation warning
    Wrap the deprecation warning message in a conditional, letting callers set a variable to quiet the warning.
  * Use DEPRECATION instead of WARNING for package deprecation messages

  * Always write generated cmake as utf8 (#136 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/136>)
    * Always write output as utf-8.
    CMake documentation suggests that we should be writing 7-bit ascii
    CMake source files or writing UTF-8 with a byte order mark. (Source:
    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/manual/cmake-language.7.html#encoding).
    This doesn't actually do either of those things. It just cements our
    position of non-compliance (writing utf-8 without a byte order mark)
    so that builds don't crash if the system encoding is other than utf-8.
    Alternatively we could sanitize the generated CMake content so it is
    7-bit ascii and explicitly write it as such or consider adding the byte
    order mark.
    * Always read package.xml as utf-8.
