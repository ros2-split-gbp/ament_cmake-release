  * Resolve various ament_lint linter violations (#360 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/360>)
    We can't add ament_lint linters in ament_cmake in the traditional way
    without creating a circular dependency between the repositories. Even
    though we can't automatically enforce linting, it's still a good idea to
    try to keep conformance where possible.

  * Fix skipped test reporting in CTest (#279 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/279>)
    This is a follow-up to c67cdf2. When the SKIP_RETURN_CODE gets set to 0,
    the value is interpreted as 'false', and the test property is never
    actually added.

ros-rolling-ament-cmake-test (1.0.0-4bullseye) bullseye; urgency=high

  * Add SKIP_RETURN_CODE argument to ament_add_test (#264 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/264>)
    This makes the run_test.py wrapper aware of the SKIP_RETURN_CODE
    property on CTest tests. In the existing implementation, the wrapper
    detects that no result file was generated and overrides the special
    return code coming from the test, making the the CTest feature fail
    completely.
    This change makes the wrapper script aware of the special return code,
    and when detected, will write a 'skipped' result file instead of a
    'failed' result file, and pass along the special return code as-is. Now
    the gtest result and the ctest results both show the test as 'skipped'
    when the special return flag is used.
    Note that none of this behavior is enabled by default, which is
    important because we wouldn't want a test to fail and return a code
    which we've decided is the special 'skip' return code. Only tests which
    are aware of this feature should use it.

    Use errors attribute for problems when testing code (take II)
  * Error message needs to be inside its own XML tag according to XSD
  * Use DEPRECATION instead of WARNING for package deprecation messages
    This makes it possible to treat the warnings differently in downstream packages.

ros-rolling-ament-cmake-test (0.9.0-4bullseye) bullseye; urgency=high

  * Report skipped tests in CTest output (#243 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/243>)
    When adding a test using ament_add_test, the SKIP_TEST argument
    results in the --skip-test argument being passed to the test wrapper
    script run_test.py. The wrapper script then writes a JUnit output
    describing that the test was skipped, and returns 0.
    As far as CTest knows, the test succeeded and shows Passed on the
    console. However, since we know that the test will be skipped by the
    wrapper, and we expect the wrapper to return 0 after it writes the JUnit
    file, we can set a test property that will mark the test as Skipped
    when the wrapper returns 0.
    This way, the JUnit output file is still written, but CTest displays the
    test as skipped as well.
  * Drop duplicated <skipped/> element in result file (#242 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/242>)
    The <skipped/> element was actually added as part of the
    skipped_message several lines earlier.
    While multiple <skipped/> elements doesn't violate the JUnit schema,
    there is no reason to have more than one.
  * add CMake function ament_add_test_label() (#240 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/240>)
  * Merge pull request #225 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/225> from ament/junit10_xsd

  * Run tests in current binary directory, not global source directory (#206 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/206>)
    Switch to CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR for consistency with CTest
