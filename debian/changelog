  * Use file(GENERATE OUTPUT) to create dsv files (#416 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/416>)
    Using file(WRITE) and file(APPEND) causes the modification stamp of the
    file to be changed each time CMake configures, resluting in an
    'Installing' message rather than an 'Up-to-date' message even though the
    file content is identical.
    Using file(GENERATE OUTPUT) updates the timestamp of the file only if
    the content changes.

  * Resolve various ament_lint linter violations (#360 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/360>)
    We can't add ament_lint linters in ament_cmake in the traditional way
    without creating a circular dependency between the repositories. Even
    though we can't automatically enforce linting, it's still a good idea to
    try to keep conformance where possible.

  * Use DEPRECATION instead of WARNING for package deprecation messages

  * Always write generated cmake as utf8 (#136 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/136>)
    * Always write output as utf-8.
    CMake documentation suggests that we should be writing 7-bit ascii
    CMake source files or writing UTF-8 with a byte order mark. (Source:
    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/manual/cmake-language.7.html#encoding).
    This doesn't actually do either of those things. It just cements our
    position of non-compliance (writing utf-8 without a byte order mark)
    so that builds don't crash if the system encoding is other than utf-8.
    Alternatively we could sanitize the generated CMake content so it is
    7-bit ascii and explicitly write it as such or consider adding the byte
    order mark.
    * Always read package.xml as utf-8.

  * addressing review comments
  * [windows] add back IS_WINDOWS in one place
  * [windows] compact file extension logic
  * simplify removal of backslashes from generated CMake
  * [windows] use "arrays" to avoid large env vars
    the limit is 8192, but that the combined number
    of characters for all the concatenated env
    hook paths for each package.
    i think it could be further separated into
    one variable per env hook per package,
    but that seemed like overkill for now.
  * [windows] add more .bat versions of env hooks
  * [windows] convert in paths to / for CMake
    Otherwise CMake will interpret them as
    escape sequences or as line continuations.
  * add has_resource function
  * disable messages about install() invocations
  * update cmake code style only
  * update dependencies
  * add marker file with run dependencies
  * fix registering resources with content
  * source environment hooks in alphanumeric order
  * use project(.. NONE)
  * refactor several low-level packages into ament_cmake_core (environment, environment_hooks, index, package_templates, symlink_install)
  * fix comments
  * refactored PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR computation
  * deal with CMake double expansion
  * add normalize_path function
  * fix assert file exists message broken by code style change
  * update cmake code style
  * minor fixes
  * code style only
  * add ament_cmake_auto
  * add ament_cmake_core
